\ -> reverse slash, for line breaking when you're feeling lazy to just add another println.
| -> latin iota (is that what it's called?), for char "or" condition.
|| -> double latin iota(still in doubt), for string "or" condition.

by removing the one operand limit on the operations in the post fix solver
any operation can be made to accept multiple operands, 
for example : 
            (2,3) + (4,5)
            this expression right now throws an exception, since the brackets provide 
            multiple operands in place of a single operand

but this limit can be easily removed, the reason I'm keeping it is just for convenience,
coz i don't really see any use of this. However, in case if this restriction needs to be removed,
it can be done in the following ways :
since multiple operands is being passed in from both left and right side,
I'll need a new function like this 
                                    void function(operand[] lefts, operand[] rights)
or for unary operations
                        void function(operand[] singles)

and now, remove the restriction in the postFix solver function in the parser. That's all.
